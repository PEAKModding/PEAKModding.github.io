PEAK Modding Wiki is a project maintained by the [PEAKModding](https://github.com/PEAKModding) organization on GitHub.
If you'd like to help us with this wiki, make sure to reach out! For smaller changes such as minor corrections, a single pull request will do fine though.

A large part of the community is on the [PEAK Modding Community](https://discord.gg/SAw86z24rB) Discord server we run which is where most discussions about maintaining this wiki and [PEAKLib](https://github.com/PEAKModding/PEAKLib) happens. That said, GitHub is also used for tracking issues.

## Type of Content

The main focus of this wiki is on providing content for mod developers. To keep this wiki small and easy to follow, we avoid writing too much duplicate content that is already documented by e.g. BepInEx or has a good page on another modding wiki.

This doesn't mean we avoid mentioning useful information though. Just that when we do, we link to other articles. For example, see the page: [Useful BepInEx APIs](/creating-a-mod/useful-bepinex-apis).

### About Modding APIs

The only API documentation this wiki hosts is [PEAKLib](https://github.com/PEAKModding/PEAKLib), the community modding API.
The benefit of this is that we can write guides for content creation with just this API in mind. We can also ensure that the project stays maintained, and all pull requests are reviewed by someone else.

Anyone can make a PEAKLib submodule, and doing so means that everything goes through code review and we help make the API good. You also won't need to do as much work to keep the API maintained as we make sure PEAKLib submodules work after game updates, and we will take care of pull requests.

If you are interested in starting a PEAKLib submodule, come chat with us on the [PEAK Modding Community](https://discord.gg/SAw86z24rB) Discord server, in the [`#peak-lib`](https://discord.com/channels/1363179626435707082/1387320203746082866) channel!

### Categories

When adding new content to this wiki, we'd hope it fits in either the **Creating a Mod** or **Content Creation** categories.
Having only two major categories helps keep the wiki easy to comprehend, as:

- **Creating a Mod** has generic articles about making and publishing any mod
- **Content Creation** focuses on creating specific types of content, typically using PEAKLib

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions to this wiki. Just make sure first you have read all of [Type of Content](#type-of-content) above. After that, come chat with us on the [PEAK Modding Community](https://discord.gg/SAw86z24rB) Discord server, in the [`#modding-wiki`](https://discord.com/channels/1363179626435707082/1385365493698924574) channel.

When it's clear what to write and how, you can start working on your new page or making modifications to existing pages.
This wiki uses Astro Starlight, so for help see its documentation which you can find in the README of the wiki on GitHub: https://github.com/PEAKModding/PEAKModding.github.io.
