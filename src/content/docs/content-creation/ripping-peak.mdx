Ripping PEAK into a Unity project is required to allow certain custom creation using Unity.

We are currently lacking a PEAK Unity Project Patcher to automate this process.
For now we must do things manually to get a semi complete rip of the game.
The process is potentially painful and time-consuming.

:::caution
Make sure to follow the instructions as closely as possible for the highest chance of success.
Do not skip steps or do them out of order.

The process would be considerably easier and less painful with a Unity project patcher like this: [R.E.P.O. Project Patcher](https://github.com/Kesomannen/unity-repo-project-patcher).

Follow the steps in this message directly to get a semi complete version of the PEAK game:

>   - If prompted, answer `Yes, for these and other files that might be found later`
> - Delete all instances of `UnitySourceGeneratedAssemblyMonoScriptTypes`
>   - There is one in `Assets\Plugins\Assembly-CSharp-firstpass\`
